Tracking good practices in the implementation of the gender perspective becomes an invaluable tool to become more equitable and inclusive societies. In the context of Open Government, where transparency and citizen participation are fundamental, the gender approach takes on even greater relevance. That's why we're diving into the Guide to Gender Responsive Action Plans, a roadmap designed to ensure that Open Government commitments are not only inclusive but also address the specific needs and priorities of women, non-binary and other underrepresented groups.

Diverse and substantive participation in governance processes, such as those carried out by the Open Government Partnership (OGP), is essential to strengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of these mechanisms. Recognition of this fact has led to the creation of the Feminist Open Government Initiative (FOGO), which seeks to generate research, data and practical tools to promote gender equality within the OGP and beyond.

One of the main strategies proposed by the Guide to Gender Responsive Action Plans is the active inclusion of women, gender groups and other underrepresented communities in the process of co-creation and implementation of OGP action plans. Examples such as Morocco and Ivory Coast demonstrate how this inclusion can be translated into concrete actions that address the specific needs of these communities.

In addition, the Guide emphasizes the importance of incorporating the gender perspective in all the commitments of the Action Plan. Countries such as Canada, Argentina and Finland have carried out extensive gender analyses to ensure that their Plans effectively address the concerns of women and other marginalized groups.

Likewise, the need to design commitments that promote gender-focused priorities is highlighted. Examples such as Germany, Sri Lanka and Brazil show how specific commitments can have a direct impact on promoting gender equality in different areas, from business leadership to the fight against gender violence.

Ultimately, tracking gender good practices in Open Government is not only a question of social justice, but also of effectiveness and legitimacy. By integrating the gender perspective into all aspects of this governance culture, we can build more inclusive, equitable and resilient societies.
