Diagnostic Report of the Project: Towards an Open State in Colombia with a Gender Perspective

The project "Inclusion of a gender perspective in the V National Open State Action Plan of Colombia" represents a reference point for the integration of the gender perspective in data governance and the co-creation of inclusive public policies. In an effort to promote equitable and diverse participation, this project pays special attention to including women and people of diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, as well as sexual characteristics (SOGIESC) in all phases of the Action Plan: from design to implementation and evaluation.

The diagnostic report of this project is the basis of the repository resources. It consists of three fundamental elements: an international benchmark, an actor mapping and a data mapping, each addressing crucial aspects for the effective inclusion of the gender perspective in data governance and for Action Plans in Colombia.

# International Benchmark: A Global Look

The international benchmark offers an overview of global practices regarding the integration of the gender perspective in data governance. Through interviews with experts on the subject, this analysis provides innovative and effective methodological recommendations to involve organizations and key actors in the project, establishing a comparative framework that inspires and guides local actions.

# Actor Mapping: Identifying Allies

Stakeholder mapping identifies people and organizations dedicated to data governance and gender perspective, underscoring the importance of collaborating with entities that promote quality data management. This effort makes the collaboration panorama visible and establishes synergies between the different actors involved in the promotion of inclusive actions.

# Data Mapping: Evaluate to Move Forward

Data mapping is essential to understand the current situation of data related to gender and diversity in Colombia. This analysis assesses the quality and accessibility of existing data, identifies areas where information is scarce or non-existent, and highlights challenges in collecting and managing gender-responsive data. Its purpose is to provide a solid basis for the formulation of recommendations that improve data governance from an inclusive perspective.

# Conclusions and Way Forward

The findings of the diagnostic report highlight the need to integrate the gender perspective in data governance in Colombia. Despite the diversity of existing actors and efforts, there is a lack of representation and attention to women and people with diverse SOGIESC. Additionally, the prevalence of non-machine-processable data formats limits their analysis and reuse.

Therefore, it is essential to advance in the development of methodologies that facilitate the inclusion of gender and diversity variables in data management. This effort must be accompanied by an improvement in the quality and accessibility of data, promoting formats that allow easy analysis and reuse.

The project "Inclusion of a gender perspective in the V Open State Action Plan of Colombia" lays the foundations for an equitable and participatory transformation in the country's subsequent Action Plans. This diagnostic report not only illuminates the path forward but also motivates all actors involved to commit to a more inclusive Open State in Colombia.
