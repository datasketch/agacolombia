Exploring the Tools: Resources for the V National Open State Action Plan of Colombia

In the constant search to promote transparency and citizen participation, Colombia has taken significant steps with the construction of its V Open State Action Plan. The Plan not only seeks to promote the pillars of open government, but also to strengthen ties between the government and civil society. But how was this plan created? What tools and resources have been used for its construction?

Diving into the methodological process, we find a variety of guides, matrices, routes and other instruments that have been fundamental in the creation of this plan. These resources have not only been used as support during planning but are now made available to the public in an accessible repository, with the intention of serving as input for future similar constructions.
