Open and Inclusive Data: Mapping Data with a Gender Perspective in Colombia

Open data in the context of an Open State is essential to promote transparency, citizen participation and innovation. Within the framework of the project "Inclusion of the gender perspective in the V National Action Plan of the Open State of Colombia", we have undertaken a data mapping with a clear objective: to identify and analyze the availability and relevance of existing information from a gender perspective. This effort is crucial to ensure that decisions are based on complete and representative information, addressing the needs and realities of women and people with diverse sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, as well as sexual characteristics (SOGIESC).

## A Detailed Process for Impact

Our mapping process was geared toward three main categories: existing data sources, missing data sources, and those requiring revision. The intention behind this evaluation is to ensure that data governance is inclusive to support decision-making and that the actions of the Colombian Open State Committee contribute to gender equality.

Throughout this process, we identified 29 relevant data sources, coming mainly from public organizations, followed by international entities, private organizations, foundations and think tanks. The collaboration and joint development of databases between these actors highlight the importance of strategic alliances.

## Challenges and Findings in Mapping

The mapping revealed a concentration of data at the national and municipal levels, with less representation at the departmental level. Although national sources provide useful comparisons with other countries, internal disaggregation is essential for a deeper understanding of local realities. Furthermore, we note that disaggregating data by sex, while useful, is not sufficient to capture the complexity of gender as a dynamic social construction. Therefore, our evaluation was extended to consider how gender interacts with other strategic variables, revealing structural inequalities.

However, we face significant challenges in data presentation and accessibility. Predominant formats, such as PDF, and the lack of adequate descriptions in databases limit the effective reuse of information. This finding highlights the need to promote downloadable and machine-readable formats, facilitating data access and analysis.

## Towards a Future of Open and Inclusive Data

Despite these challenges, we identified significant opportunities to improve gender-responsive data governance. Open data portals, both local and international, offer examples of how data can be accessible and reusable, serving as a model for future initiatives.

When analyzing the themes of the databases, it is evident that certain areas, such as economic indicators and violence against women, have received more attention. However, the lack of data on violence experienced by people with diverse SOGIESC and the limited representation of these experiences in accessible formats are critical areas.

This data mapping not only provides the current state of gender-sensitive information in Colombia but also establishes a solid foundation for our recommendations. By identifying gaps and challenges in data availability and accessibility, we can begin to chart a path toward more inclusive and equitable data governance.
